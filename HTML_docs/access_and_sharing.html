Initial access to data about your faction is via the intro page
with a username/password such as
http://tornutopia.com/intro/forged_through_war/

<p>
You obtain the uername/password from cockroach by asking him in-game.
I suggest not sharing your password.

<p>
At the intro page you get a link to a player table for your faction and links
to other pages to do with crime.

<p>
At the pages you reach after following links from the intro page there is no
password required but the URLs are generated using a hash function and cannot
be guessed efficiently.  You can share these URLs with other people who will then
be able to view those pages.  The URLs are changed every week so if you do share
something it goes out of date automatically.

<p>
One case you might want to share is showing your individual page when you
apply for a job or faction membership.  The link is found in the first column
of the player table and includes the maximum days idle (that is no change
in total crimes).  

<p>
The whole player table is probably more than you'd want to share with someone
outside the faction.

<p>
The website operator takes the view that the site displays data to users who
have used a password and if they share that data further it is their act and
the site has permission from those users to show a page to anyone
who knows the URL.

Initial access to data about your faction is via the intro page
with a username/password such as
http://tornutopia.com/intro/forged_through_war/

<p>
You obtain the uername/password from cockroach by asking him in-game.

<p>
At that page you get a link to a player table for your faction and a list
of organised crime types (numbers 1-8 are used by Torn).  The link next
to each of the numbers that has been used shows a record of the OC by
your faction.

<p>
The player table has links in the last column to the
same data broken down by player (with additional data on a player's
state and location when OC was due).  If there is comparison data available
between one player and others that wil be provided as a link.  In that
way you might see that an OC with a certain team is more successful than the
same team with one player swapped.

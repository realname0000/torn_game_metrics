<h3>Organised crime count</h3>
<p>
There is an award at 100 OC and your leader may use this count to plan what OC to include you in.
Is your OC count correct?  If your API key is not on record and you are new to the faction (or your faction is new to tornutopia) it might not be.
<p>
If your API key is not known your OC count is increased when OC are seen to be executed but this would not know about your record so far.
<p>
Current value is {{ player.oc_calc }}; enter the number using the link below to correct it.
